Network State Management
=========

Ansible's Network Resource Modules are the solution to managing device states across different devices and different device types. NRMs already have the logic built in to know how config properties need to be orchestrated in which specific ways, and these modules know how to run the behind-the-scenes commands that get you the desired configuration state.

This role uses a pre-defined state definition, as if config values were being retrieved from a CMDB.

Examples
----------------

Interface template:
```
interface_config:
- interface: Ethernet1/1
  description: ansible_managed-Te0/1/2
  enabled: True
  mode: trunk
  portchannel_id: 100

- interface: Ethernet1/2
  enabled: False

- interface: port-channel100
  description: vPC PeerLink
  mode: trunk
  enabled: True
  vpc_peerlink: True
  members:
    - member: Ethernet1/1
      mode: active
    - member: Ethernet1/36
      mode: active
```

Using the network resource modules, we  define our desired interface state and Ansible will run the necessary commands:

```
- name: Configure Interface Settings
  nxos_interfaces:
    config:
      name: "{{ item['interface'] }}"
      description: "{{ item['description'] }}"
      enabled: "{{ item['enabled'] }}"
      mode: "{% if 'ip_address' in item %}layer3{% else %}layer2{% endif %}"
    state: replaced
  loop: "{{ interface_config }}"
  when: (interface_config is defined and (item['enabled'] == True))
```
